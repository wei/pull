+-Map your QuickBooks contractor payments to 1099 boxes
+-First select the checkbox for each type of contractor payment you recorded last year. Each payment type corresponds to a box on the IRS forms 1099-NEC or 1099-MISC. (Non-employee compensation and rents are the two most common types.)
+-Then for each payment type selected, select all the QuickBooks expense accounts you used last year. Need more help with this page?
+-If you’re not sure which expense accounts you used, you can run a report of all last year’s expenses marked for 1099.
+-Something’s not quite right
+-You can't add data to QuickBooks Online Ecosystem because your trial or subscription period ended, you canceled your subscription, or there was a billing problem. To update your subscription, click the gear icon and view your account information.
