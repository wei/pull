## Features

 - Ensure forks are updated.
 - Automatically integrate new changes from upstream.
 - Pull requests are created when upstreams are updated.
 - Automatically merge or hard reset pull requests to match upstream.
 - Add assignees and reviewers to pull requests.
 - Customize pull request label.
 - Honor branch protection rules.
 - Work well with pull request checks and reviews.

### Prerequisites
 - Upstream must be in the same fork network.
 - :warning: _Make a backup if you've made changes._

## Getting Started

**[‚≠ê Star this project](https://github.com/wei/pull)** (Highly recommended, starred users may receive priority over regular users)

### Basic Setup

 - Just install **[<img src="https://prod.download/pull-18h-svg" valign="bottom"/> Pull app](https://github.com/apps/pull)**.

Pull app will automatically watch and pull in upstream's default (master) branch to yours using **hard reset** every few hours. You can also manually [trigger](#trigger-manually) it anytime.

### Advanced Setup (with config)

 1. Create a new branch.
 2. Setup the new branch as default branch under repository Settings > Branches.
 3. Add `.github/pull.yml` to your default branch.

    #### Most Common
    (behaves the same as Basic Setup)
    ```yaml
    version: "1"
    rules:
      - base: master
        upstream: wei:master    # change `wei` to the owner of upstream repo
        mergeMethod: hardreset
    ```

    #### Advanced usage
    ```yaml
    version: "1"
    rules:                      # Array of rules
      - base: master            # Required. Target branch
        upstream: wei:master    # Required. Must be in the same fork network.
        mergeMethod: hardreset  # Optional, one of [none, merge, squash, rebase, hardreset], Default: none.
        mergeUnstable: false    # Optional, merge pull request even when the mergeable_state is not clean. Default: false
      - base: dev
        upstream: master        # Required. Can be a branch in the same forked repo.
        assignees:              # Optional
          - wei
        reviewers:              # Optional
          - wei
        conflictReviewers:      # Optional, on merge conflict assign a reviewer
          - wei
    label: ":arrow_heading_down: pull"  # Optional
    conflictLabel: "merge-conflict"     # Optional, on merge conflict assign a custom label, Default: merge-conflict
    ```

 4. Go to `https://pull.git.ci/check/${owner}/${repo}` to validate your `.github/pull.yml` (Public repos only). See [#234](https://github.com/wei/pull/issues/234) for another way to validate it.
 5. Install **[![<img src="https://prod.download/pull-18h-svg" valign="bottom"/> Pull](https://prod.download/pull-18h-svg) Pull app](https://github.com/apps/pull)**.

### Trigger manually

Go to `https://pull.git.ci/process/${owner}/${repo}` to manually trigger pull.
**Note:** Nothing will happen if your branch is already even with upstream.


## For Repository Owners

For the most common use case (a single `master` branch), you can just direct users to install Pull with no configurations.
If you need a more advanced setup (such as a `docs` branch in addition to `master`), consider adding `.github/pull.yml` to your repository pointing to yourself (see example). This will allow forks to install Pull and stay updated automatically.

Example (assuming `owner` is your user or organization name):
```yaml
version: "1"
rules:
  - base: master
    upstream: owner:master
    mergeMethod: hardreset
  - base: docs
    upstream: owner:docs
    mergeMethod: hardreset
```
